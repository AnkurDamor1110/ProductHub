# ProductHub
This project is a Product Management System(ProductHub) built to allow users to add, view and delete products. The application consists of a React-based frontend, an Node.js backend, and MongoDB as the database. It supports key CRUD (Create, Read, Delete) operations and is styled for a modern user experience with features like modals, notifications, and responsive design. The backend integrates MongoDB Atlas for database storage, and the entire system is deployed using scalable and efficient cloud services.
